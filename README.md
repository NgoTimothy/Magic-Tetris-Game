# Magic Tetris Game
This game plays similary to the game Tetris with a slight twist.  1 of 6 shapes picked randomly begin to fall from the top of the game window.  Each piece has the ability to fall faster with a the press of the down arrow key, left with the left arrow key or right with the right arrow key.  Depending on the shape a piece can transfrom in a ccw manner, flip verticaly on it's axis or do nothing at all if the up arrow key is pressed.  Once a shape can no longer fall further it stops and places itself at the position.  If a row is filled with blocks, the row collapses by one along with rows above it.  The twist in the game is that there are "magic" blocks.  A shape can only have one magic block and it has a 20% chance of appearing.  For each magic block in a collapsed row, the score is increased by the additive 2^(number of magic blocks).  If there is 3 or more magic blocks in a collpased row, then now only does the row collapse but empty spaces with a block above it collpase to fill the blank space and shapes fall at a faster rate.
